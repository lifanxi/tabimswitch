=== Why the input method changes back to English after I navigate back from a pop up window?===

You may try to enable Firefox's "Per Windows Per Keyboard Layout" setting.
  # Open a new tab, and type about:config in the address bar.
  # From the page, find the item _`intl.keyboard.per_window_layout`_, and change the value to _`true`_
  # If you may not find the item, right-click on any item, and select _New_ -> _Boolean_, from the popup window, type _`intl.keyboard.per_window_layout`_, click OK, and select value as _`true`_.
  # Restart Firefox.

Because Firefox has this setting, so when I design TabIMSwitch, I did not support multiple wIndow IM state switch, because people can use this setting to workaround.
