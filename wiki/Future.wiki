= The Future of TabIMSwitch =

TabIMSwitch now supports Windows Keyboard Layout switching with tab switching, but some detailed input method properties is not supported, such as fullshape or not fullshape for Chinese Input Method ^1^, and Hiragana mode or Katagana mode for Japanese Input Method ^2^.
For example, you turned Chinese Input Method on for two tabs, but enabled fullshape for one tab, and disable fullshape for another, when switching between tabs, user may expect the input method property also changes. This is what we will do in next step.

_*Task 1: Adding more detailed input method control to TabIMSwitch*_
