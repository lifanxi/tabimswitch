TabIMSwitch is  an FireFox  extension which  enables FireFox  to save  the Input
Method  of each  Tab and  change it  accordingly when  switching tabs.  It  also
enables disabling Input Method for address bar.

For most east-Asian user such as Chinese/Korean/Japanese, people always have  to
use Input Methods for  typing characters. But FireFox  2.0 has poor support  for
intelligent Input Method switching. For  example, people may open several  tabs,
one for writing blog in Chinese, one for writing wiki in English, and the  other
for chatting (via  Google Talk online)  with Japanese friends  in Japanese. When
switching between  these tabs,  people may  expect the  Input method  can switch
intelligently. But FireFox 2.0 does not support that.

To enable this feature for FireFox, this extension is developed. The feature  of
the extension includes:

    * Save  the input  method status  of each  tab and  switch the  input method
      according to current  tab.
    * Switch  to English input  method when focus  on address  bar. 
    * Switch  the  input  method  status  when  changing between different windows.
      (New in 1.0.0.7)

Version 1.0 supports Windows 2000/XP/2003  with FireFox 2.0.0.* only. We  expect
porting it to Linux SCIM platform and other versions of FireFox.

Now, download and begin to enjoy it!
